                It all started at the age 14 when I had this obsession to be the best at what I do, and that was cleaning cars. I always believed that no person should ever drive a dirty vehicle. As a young boy my father would always ask me to clean his car in which most boys at that age would find very frustrating, but for me it was the opposite  as that was the opportunity to do what I loved most.

                Growing up I thought I would lose my passion and determination for my trade, yet with eaching passing year I felt the urge and hunger to do beter and strive for more.

                One day, after another successful clean and a very happy client, he asked me why I have'nt considered starting my own car washing business. After careful consideration I eventually decided to go forth and take the risk, in which I initially started with a door to door service, where I would go to people's houses and wash their cars at the expense of their own water and electricity ofcourse. Although people did not consider me the best at first  my tenacity and peserverence kept me going as I strongly believed that I had to start somewhere in order to be the best.

                I firmly believe in starting small as this sets the foundation in which a person crawls and elevates to greater heights where I later learned to walk and even if I had all the money to buy the best equipment, I would still prefer to start by hand to show people out there that even if you have nothing to begin your journey  with, as long as you have the passion for doing the things you love the most.
